                  I am a first-generation college student studying Computer
                  Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Physics, at Bates
                  College. Driven by an insatiable curiosity and a love for
                  problem-solving, I am passionate about using technology to
                  transform raw ideas into intuitive and impactful solutions. My
                  goal is to develop intentional applications that continuously
                  evolve, adapt, and bring real value to peopleâ€™s lives.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I am always looking for ways to learn, grown and complete the
                  next project. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects,
                  keeping up with emerging trends in AI, Fintech and Softwae
                  Development.

                  When Iâ€™m not coding or solving problems, youâ€™ll probably find
                  me on the soccer field, playing volleyball, or even diving
                  into a game of rugby. I also love video games, jamming on my
                  guitar, and getting lost in good music or my favorite shows.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Iâ€™m currently on the lookout for internship opportunities
                  where I can put my skills in data science and full-stack
                  development to workâ€”whether thatâ€™s through predictive
                  modeling, database management, or building intuitive
                  applications that make data more actionable. Iâ€™m always eager
                  to learn, collaborate, and take on exciting challenges that
                  push me to grow as both a developer and a problem solver. If
                  youâ€™re working on something cool, letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€
