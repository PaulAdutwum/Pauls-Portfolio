                  , a rising junior at Bates College, studying Computer Science
                  and Mathematics. I'm also an active member of the Africana
                  Community at Bates and serve as a Community Advisor in the
                  Office of Residential Life & Health Education.
                  <br />
                  <br />I am interested in building tech solutions that adds
                  value to our lives, focusing on full-stack development,
                  web/mobile applications, and data analysis. I've participated
                  in hackathons in both data science and web development,
                  collaborating on impactful projects.

                  I love learning and growing, constantly pushing myself to
                  explore new technologies and improve my skills. I'm always
                  excited about new opportunities and enjoy working on projects
                  that create meaningful impact. I am currently seeking
                  internship opportunities for the summer of 2025 and excited to
                  contribute meaningfully to any team I join.

                  Beyond coding, you'll find me on the soccer field,
                  volunteering, diving into photography, working on fitness, or
                  embracing diverse cultures and languages.
