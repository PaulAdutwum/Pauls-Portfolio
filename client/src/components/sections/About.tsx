                  I am a first-generation college student studying Computer
                  Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Physics, at Bates
                  College. I am a highly driven person with an insatiable
                  curiosity for problem-solving and a deep passion for
                  understanding the world through data and computation.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of data
                  science and full-stack developmentâ€”where analytical rigor
                  meets creative design. I enjoy exploring patterns, analyzing
                  trends, and transforming insights into data-driven decisions
                  and predictive models. At the same time, I leverage my
                  full-stack development skills to build scalable, intuitive
                  applications that make data visualization more accessible and
                  impactful.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Beyond academics, I am a self-motivated learner who enjoys
                  contributing to open-source projects, engaging in discussions
                  on emerging tech trends in AI, FinTech, and software
                  development, and continuously expanding my knowledge through
                  hands-on projects.

                  When Iâ€™m not coding or solving problems, you can find me
                  playing soccer, watching my favorite shows, or engaging in
                  debates on current issues in technology and finance.
                  <br />
                  <br />I am currently seeking internship opportunities that
                  allow me to apply my skills in data science and full-stack
                  developmentâ€”whether through predictive modeling, database
                  management, or building applications that make data more
                  intuitive and actionable. I am excited to collaborate, learn,
                  and contribute to meaningful projects that challenge me to
                  grow as both a developer and a thinker. If youâ€™re working on
                  something exciting, letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€
